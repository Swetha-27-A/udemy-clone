# udemy-clone

Iâ€™m excited to share my Udemy Clone website â€” a full stack learning project where I focused on building the frontend using basic HTML and CSS!

This project is inspired by the popular e-learning platform Udemy, and it helped me understand how real-world learning platforms are structured, both visually and functionally.

âœ¨ Key Features:

Clean and responsive layout

Course listing design with pricing

Homepage, course detail sections, and simple navigation

Styled using only HTML and basic CSS

ðŸ’» Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS

This project helped me strengthen my frontend skills and prepare for building more dynamic, interactive web apps.
